# gwen-dotnet
Port of the popular GWEN library for .NET/Mono

This is a fork of the original GWEN.NET which can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/gwen-dotnet/)  
Aims of this fork:
* Use modern OpenGL
* Integrate it into our 3D game framework [FreezingArcher](https://github.com/fin-ger/FreezingArcher)
* Allow usage of GWEN in a really convenient way
