GWEN.Net is a .Net port of GWEN. GWEN is a lightweight GUI library aimed at games. It contains rich widget collection and most functionality you'd expect from a GUI framework. See http://code.google.com/p/gwen/ and https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/gwen-discuss for details.

Original code is C++ written by Garry Newman. GWEN.Net is NOT a wrapper/binding and does not need the original C++ library. It's a complete rewrite in C# for use by .NET applications.
